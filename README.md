# ArcaneChat
A chat app that is visibly secure.

## Purpose
On a personal chat, I don't want others to peep into my chat and be able to accidentally read through my personal messages.
And I don't care much about all the messages that flow on the screen, except mostly for the latest one. So, why not encrypt them instead and show the actual text when tapped on it?
